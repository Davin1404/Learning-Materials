# 2. Electrical resistance
**Definition**: the ratio of potential difference to current
$R=\frac{F}{I}$
Units: current in amperes, pd in volts, resistance in ohms or volt per amp

In series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of resistance of each component
In parallel circuit, the reciprocal of total resistance of the sum of reciprocal of resistance of each component

# 3. Ohm's law
In a conductor, when the resistance is constant, the current is directly proportional to potential difference
$I=\frac{V}{R}$
Any component that follows ohm's law is called ohmic component
In a graph of voltage against current, the gradient of the **segment connecting origin and a point on line** equals to the **reciprocal of resistance** at that point

For a lot of components that don't follow ohm's law, when the voltage is low, the temperature is too law to affect the resistance, but as the voltage increases, the temperature rises and the resistance goes down. *Like the filament lamp*

In the diode, there is a **threshold voltage**, only after which the diode can conduct electricity (otherwise there wouldn't be enough energy to move the electrons)

# 4. Resistivity
Resistivity = resistance * cross-sectional area / length
$\rho=\frac{RA}{l}$

# 5. Heating effect of current
When the temperature is too high, the electron collides with other atoms and lose kinetic energy

# 6. Electrical Power
The rate of energy transfer
Power = energy transgerred / time
$p=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{VQ}{t}=VI=I^2R$

# B.2 Thermodynamics
## B.2.1 Internal energy (U)
The internal energy $U$ of a system is the total of the potential ennergy and the random kinetic energy of all the particles making up the system.  
$$U=E_k +E_p\space $$
For ideal gas that $E_p = 0$: ($k_B=6.02\times 10^{23}$)
$$U=E_k=\frac{3}{2}Nk_BT=\frac{3}{2}nN_Ak_BT$$
$$(n=\frac{N}{N_A}=\frac{m(g)}{m(g\space mol^{-1})})$$
$n =$ *amount of substance (mol)*
$$\because k_B=\frac{R}{N_A}$$
$R =$ *molar gas constant*
$$\therefore U=\frac{3}{2}nN_A\frac{R}{N_A}T=\frac{3}{2}nRT $$

## B.2.2 The first law of thermodynamics
$$Q=\Delta U+W$$
$U=$  *the energy transferred from the surroundings to the system.*  
$\Delta U =$ *the increase in the internal energy of the system (this is not simply a change, it is an increase)*  
$W=$ *the work done by the system as it expands and pushed back the surroundings.*  
|sign|$Q$|$\Delta$U|$W$|
|---|---|---|---|
|Positive|Thermal energy is **added** to the system|**Increase** in internal energy|Work is done **by** the gas|
|Negative|Thermal energy is **removed** from the system|**Decrease** in internal energy|Work is done **on** the gas|

### The work done in an isobaric change 
$$W=p\Delta V$$

###  The work done for a non-isobaric change
*Total energy = Area of the curve*
$$W_t=\sum_n W_n=\sum_n p_n \Delta V_n$$

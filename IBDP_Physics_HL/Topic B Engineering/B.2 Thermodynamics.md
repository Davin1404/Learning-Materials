# B.2 Thermodynamics
## B.2.1 Internal energy (U)
The internal energy $U$ of a system is the total of the potential ennergy and the random kinetic energy of all the particles making up the system.  
$$U=E_k +E_p\space \tag{1}$$
For ideal gas that $E_p = 0$: ($k_B=6.02\times 10^{23}$)
$$U=E_k=\frac{3}{2}Nk_BT=\frac{3}{2}nN_Ak_BT\tag{2}$$
$$(n=\frac{N}{N_A}=\frac{m(g)}{m(g\space mol^{-1})})$$
$n =$ *amount of substance (mol)*
$$\because k_B=\frac{R}{N_A}\tag{3}$$
$R =$ *molar gas constant*
$$\therefore U=\frac{3}{2}nN_A\frac{R}{N_A}T$$
$$U=\frac{3}{2}nRT \tag{4}$$  
$$\Delta U=\frac{3}{2}P\Delta V\tag{5}$$

## B.2.2 The first law of thermodynamics
$$Q=\Delta U+W\tag{6}$$
$U=$  *the energy transferred from the surroundings to the system.*  
$\Delta U =$ *the increase in the internal energy of the system (this is not simply a change, it is an increase)*  
$W=$ *the work done by the system as it expands and pushed back the surroundings.*  
|sign|$Q$|$\Delta$U|$W$|
|---|---|---|---|
|Positive|Thermal energy is **added** to the system from surrounding|**Increase** in internal energy|Work is done **by** the gas|
|Negative|Thermal energy is **removed** from the system to surrounding|**Decrease** in internal energy|Work is done **on** the gas|

### The work done in an isobaric change 
$$W=p\Delta V \tag{7}$$

###  The work done for a non-isobaric change
*Total energy = Area of the curve*
$$W_t=\sum_n W_n=\sum_n p_n \Delta V_n$$

### Isothermal changes (in ideal gas)
$\Delta U=0$  
No change in the temperature of the system, the internal energy of the system staying constant.  
$$\therefore Q=W$$

$$pV=nRT\tag{8}$$  

$$P=\frac{k}{V}=constant\tag{9}$$

### Adiabatic changes (in ideal gas)
$Q=0$  
No thermal energy is transferred between the system annd the surroundings
$$\therefore \Delta U=W$$

#### Adiabatic processes for monatomic gases
$$pV^{\frac{5}{3}}=constant\tag{10}$$

Although during an adiabatic process there is no thermal enery transfer with the surroudings, the temperature of the gas will change because ***work has been done***.  

### Isovolumetric changes
$W=0$  
No work can be done by or on the system  
$$Q=\Delta U$$ 
The equation of state for an isovolumetric change is: 
$$\frac{P}{T}=constant\tag{11}$$

### P-V diagrams and thermodynamic cycles

## B.2.3 Cycles and Engines
### Principle of heat engine
Take in energy at a high temperature, reject energy at a low temperature and use the remainder of the energy to do work on the system.  

$$\text{useful work done}=W=Q_1-Q_2$$  

### The Carnot cycle
The area enclosed by the curve is the net work done by the gas on the surroundings in one cycle.  
$$\eta =\frac{\text{useful work done}}{\text{energy input}}=\frac{W}{Q_1}=\frac{Q_1-Q_2}{Q_1}\tag{12}$$
$$\therefore \eta = 1-\frac{Q_2}{Q_1}=1-\frac{T_{\text{cold}}(\text{K})}{T_{\text{hot}}(\text{K})}\tag{13}$$  

$$\eta = \text{The efficiency}$$

## B.2.4 The Second Law of Thermodynamics  

### The Clausius version of the second law  
It is impossible to transfer energy from a body at a lower temperature to one at higher temperature without doing work on the system.  

### The Kelvin (or Kelvin-Planck) version  
It is impossible to extract energy from a hot reservoir and transfer this entirely into work.  

### Entropy  
A third version of the second law of thermodynamics involves the concept of entropy $S$.  

$$\Delta S=\frac{\Delta Q}{T}$$  

$$\Delta S = \text{the increase in entropy}$$  

$$\Delta Q = \text{is the energy absorbed by the system}$$  

$$T = \text{the temperature in kelvin at which this occurs}$$  

Entropy is a ***scalar quantity*** and has units of **joule per kelvin** ( $\text{J K}^{-1}$ )

* When energy is absorbed by a system, $\Delta Q>0$, a positive change in entropy-increase;  
* When energy is rejected by the system, $\Delta Q<0$, the entropy will decrease;  

⚠️The total entropy of the universe **INCREASES**.⚠️😡

State abd explain at which point in the cycle ABCA the entropy of the gas is the largest.  
![shapeOfTheCurve](/IBDP_Physics_HL/Topic%20B%20Engineering/image/cycle%20ABCA.png)

Entropy is largest at B, entorpy increases from A to B because $T=\text{constant}$, but volume increases, so more ***disorder***.  

$\Delta S = \frac{\Delta Q}{T}$, $\Delta Q>0$, $\therefore \Delta S>0$

### Entropy as a measure of disorder  
Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system or energy unavailable to do work.  

Increase in entropy means when the entropy increases, there is an increase in the degree of disorder of the system.

> When a chicken develops inside an egg, the entropy of the egg and its contents decreases. Explain how this observation is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.  
>
> Entropy of the surroundings must increase more than the decrease of entropy in the developing egg. The energy generated by the biochemical process within the egg becomes more spread out as a consequence of some passing into the surroundings.

# B.4 Forced vibrations and resonance
## B.4.1 Free or forced vibrations  
|Free vibration|Forced vibration|
|---|---|
|Body oscillates without external forces applied|Body is made to vibrate by an external periodic force/driving oscillator|  

## B.4.2 Dampled oscillation
### Damping  
Reduction in amplitude or energy of oscillations due to resistive forces.  

### Three types of damped oscillations  
|Under(light)-damped|Critically damped|Over-damped|
|---|---|---|
|Amplitude gradually decreases|A system returning to its equilibrium position in the shortest possible time|A system taking longer time to return to the equilibrium position|

## B.4.3 Resonance
|Driving/Forced frequency|Natural frequency|
|---|---|
|Frequency at which object is made to oscillate|Frequency at which object vibrates when free to do so |

Maximum amplitude of vibration of oscillating body when forced frequency equals natural frequency (of vibration).  

### Graph for resonance and dampling (driving frequency)  
* For zero damping
  * The amplitude would be infinite, however, this could not happen in partice because infinite amplitude would require an infinite amount of energy to be supplied
* As the damping increases the peak moves slightly to the left of the natural frequency.  
* Increased dampling reduces the sharpness of the resonance peak.

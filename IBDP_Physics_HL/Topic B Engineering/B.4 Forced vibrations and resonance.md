# B.4 Forced vibrations and resonance
## B.4.1 Free or forced vibrations  
|Free vibration|Forced vibration|
|---|---|
|Body oscillates without external forces applied|Body is made to vibrate by an external periodic force/driving oscillator|  

## B.4.2 Dampled oscillation
### Damping  
Reduction in amplitude or energy of oscillations due to resistive forces.  

### Three types of damped oscillations  
|Under(light)-damped|Critically damped|Over-damped|
|---|---|---|
|Amplitude gradually decreases|A system returning to its equilibrium position in the shortest possible time|A system taking longer time to return to the equilibrium position|

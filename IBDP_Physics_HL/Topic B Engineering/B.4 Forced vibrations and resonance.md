# B.4 Forced vibrations and resonance
## B.4.1 Free or forced vibrations  
|Free vibration|Forced vibration|
|---|---|
|Body oscillates without external forces applied|Body is made to vibrate by an external periodic force/driving oscillator|  

## B.4.2 Dampled oscillation
### Damping  
Reduction in amplitude or energy of oscillations due to resistive forces.  

### Three types of damped oscillations  
|Under(light)-damped|Critically damped|Over-damped|
|---|---|---|
|Amplitude gradually decreases|A system returning to its equilibrium position in the shortest possible time|A system taking longer time to return to the equilibrium position|

## B.4.3 Resonance
|Driving/Forced frequency|Natural frequency|
|---|---|
|Frequency at which object is made to oscillate|Frequency at which object vibrates when free to do so |

Maximum amplitude of vibration of oscillating body when forced frequency equals natural frequency (of vibration).  

* ‚òùÔ∏èü§ìResonant frequency = natural frequency 

### Graph for resonance and dampling (driving frequency)  
* For zero damping
  * The amplitude would be infinite, however, this could not happen in partice because infinite amplitude would require an infinite amount of energy to be supplied
* As the damping increases the peak moves slightly to the left of the natural frequency.  
* Increased dampling reduces the sharpness of the resonance peak.

## Q factor
The "quality" factor is a criterion by which the sharpness of resonance can be assessed.  
$Q$ has no unit.  

$$Q=2\pi \frac{\text{energy stored}}{\text{energy dissipated per cycle}}$$  

$$2\pi \times \text{resonant frequency}\times \frac{\text{energy stored}}{\text{power loss}}$$  

|Oscillator|Q factor|
|---|---|
|Critically damped door|$0.5$|
|Loaded test tube oscillating in water|$10$|
|Mass on spring|$50$|
|Simple pendulum|$200$|
|Oscillating quartz crystal|$30,000$|

* The larger the $Q$ factor, the sharper the resonance peak on the graph of amplitude against driving frequency.  
* A ***high quality*** factor means a low loss of energy (low damping).  
* The $Q$ factor is approximately the number of oscillations that the system will make before its amplitude decays to zero.  

## The useful and destructive effects of resonance  
|Useful effects||
|---|---|
|**Microwave cooker**|emit electromagnetic waves that match the natural frequency of water molecules in food|
|**Musical instrument**|the sound box of musical instruments amplifies the energy, causing air in the box to resonate at the same frequency |

|Destructive effects|
|---|
|The Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington State, USA, collapsed in November 1940 as a result of cross winds matching its natural frequency|

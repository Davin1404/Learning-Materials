# B.3 Fluids and Fluids dynamics
## B.3.1 Static fluids - density and pressure 
### Density - a property of matter
The mass per unit volume of a substance.  
$$\text{density}=\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}\tag{1}$$  
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

### Pressure
The normal force acting per unit cross-sectional area  
$$\text{pressure}=\frac{\text{normal force}}{\text{cross-sectional area}}\tag{2}$$  
$$P=\frac{F}{A}$$  

### Hydrostatic Pressure in a Fluid  
$$P=\rho gh\tag{3}$$  
$$h=\text{depth}$$
$$g=\text{Gravitational field strength}$$  

⚠️Total pressure $P$ at depth $h$:
$$P=\rho gh+p_0\tag{4}$$  
$$p_0=\text{Atmospheric pressure}$$

### U tube
$$h_1 \rho _1=h_2 \rho_2 \tag{5}$$

### Pascal'ss principle  
The pressure applied at one point in an enclosed fluid under equilibrium conditions is transmitted equally to all parts of the fluid.  

$$p_1=\frac{F_1}{A_1}=\frac{F_2}{A_2}\tag{6}$$  

$$P_1 = \text{Pressure throughout fluid}$$

## B.3.2 Archimedes' principle  
For an object wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, there will be an upward buoyancy force (upthrust) acting on the object which is equal to the weight of fluid that the object displaces.   

$$B=\rho _f V_f g\tag{7}$$  
$$B = \text{Buoyancy (upthrust) force}$$
$$V_f = \text{Volume of fluid that the object displaces}$$  

#### ⚠️The origin of the buoyancy force:   
Pressure in a liquid increases with depth, so pressure at bottom of bubble greater than pressure at top.  

## B.3.3 Fluid dynamics  
### An ideal fluid  
An ideal fluid offers ***no resistance*** either to a solid moving through it or it moving through or around a solid object.   

* ***Non-viscous***
  * Does not exert forces on other fluids.  
* ***Laminar*** flow
  * Fluid velocity of a point in the fluid is constant.  
* ***Incompressible*** 
  * The fluid cannot be compressed and so density is constant throughout.  

### Streamline (or laminar) flow  
#### Streamline 
The paths taken by particles within a fluid.  

#### The continuity equation

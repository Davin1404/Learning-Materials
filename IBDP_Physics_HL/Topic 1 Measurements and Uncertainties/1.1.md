# 1.1

## Orders of magnitude and estimation  
A number rounded to the nearest power of $10$ is called an order of magnitude.  

$$10^{0.5}\approx3.16$$
for $3\times 10^5$
$$3<3.16=10^{0.5}$$
$$\therefore 3\times 10^5 \approx 10^5$$

for $4\times 10^5$
$$4>3.16=10^{0.5}$$
$$\therefore 4\times 10^5 \approx 10^{5+1}=10^6$$

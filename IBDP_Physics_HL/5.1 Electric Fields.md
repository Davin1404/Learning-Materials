# 1. Electric charge
Like charges repel, unlike charges attract
**Charge carriers:** any charge particle that contribute to an electric current
**Charge is quantised:** The amount of electric charge is always the integer multiple of *e*
$e=1.6\times10 ^{-19} C$
**Charge is conserved**: electric charge cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred

# 2. Coulomb's law for the electric force
any two point charges exert an electrical force on each other
it is like the newton's law of gravitation
$F = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$where k = $8.99\times10^9$
any isolated sphere conductor can be considered as a point charge

# 3. Electric field
A region where an electric charge experiences a force
It is represented by **electric field lines**

## Electric field lines
starts at positive charge, ends at negative charge

If no force is reacted -> no resultant electric field
If a test charge is placed between two positive charges, the individual force is counteracted

The field strength near each charge is stronger than the midpoint of two charges
It's like a qradratic function graph concaving up

Uniform electric field

## Electric field strength
Electric field strength is the force per unit positive charge
$E=\frac{F}{q}=k\frac{Q}{r^2}$
where Q is the source charge and q is the test charge
It has the same direction as force on positive charge, and the tangent of electric field lines
**THE FACTORS OF EFS ARE THE AMOUNT OF SOURCE CHARGE AND THE SQUARE OF SEPERATION!!**
In an even electric field, such as between two charged plates, the EFS can be represented as $E=\frac{V}{d}$, or **potential difference over distance.**
# 4. Electric current
Rate of flow of electric charge past a point
For the electrons to flow, there has to be electric potential difference, which means that there is electric field

Q = It

The equation for current in a current-carrying conductor
$N=n\frac{v\Delta A}{V}$
$Q=Ne=nv\Delta t A e$
$I=\frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{nv\Delta t A e}{\Delta t}$
$I=nAvq$
N is total number of charge carriers
n is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, or **number density**, decided by the material, same material always has the same n
v is mean drift velocity

# 5. Electric potential difference
potential different between two points is the work done per unit charge to move a point charge from one point to the other

$V=\frac{W}{Q}$
It does not depend on the path
**Electronvolt**: the work done when a charge equal to one one electron charge is taken across a potential different of one volt
$1eV=1.6\times 10^{-19}C\times 1V = 1.6\times10^{-19}J$

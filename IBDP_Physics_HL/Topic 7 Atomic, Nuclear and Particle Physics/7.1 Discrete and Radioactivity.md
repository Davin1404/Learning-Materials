# 7.1 Discrete and Radioactivity
## Understanding 
* Discrete energy and discrete energy levels  
* Transitions between energy levels  
* Radioactive decay  
* Fundamental forces and their properties  
* Alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays   
* Half-life  
* Absorption characteristics of decay particles  
* Isotopes  
* Background radiation  

## Rutherfordâ€™s Gold Foil Experiment
### Observation
* Most of the alpha particles are undeflected.  

* Some deflected by small angles less than $90\degree$

* A small number of alpha particles rebounded by large angles more than $90\degree$.  

### Conclusion
* As most alpha particles passed through the gold foil atoms undeviated, Rutherford concluded that most of the atom was actually empty space.

* The deviation of some alpha particles from their original path were due to positive charges within the foil.

* A small number of alpha particles had rebounded because they collided with something much larger and heavier and which contains a concentrated region of positive charge.

### The Atom 
* **Atom**
  * ***Nucleus*** (radius: $10^{-15}m$)

[7.3.1 Elementary Particles - Exchange Particles](./7.3%20The%20Structure%20of%20Matter.md#exchange-particles)

* Electronstatic interaction / Coulomb force
* Strong nuclear force
* Weak nuclear force
* Gravitational force

## 7.1.2 Energy Level
It refers to the ***amount of energy*** an electron possesses of a ***given orbit***.  

Starting from ***ground state*** (the innermost orbit), the amount of energy ***increases*** as ***radius increases***.  

The ***loss of energy*** of the electron during a *transition* from a *higher* energy to a *lower* energy level leads to the ***emission*** of a ***single photon*** of light.  
$$E_2-E_1=hf$$
$$\therefore E_{\gamma} = hf\tag{1}$$
$$E_{\gamma} = \text{The energy carried by a photon}$$
$$h = \text{Plank constant}(6.63\times 10^{-34}\text{Js})$$
$$f = \text{Frequency of the radiation} $$

Furthermore, we can relate the energy to the ***wavelength***.  
$$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{\gamma}}\tag{2}$$
$$\lambda = \text{Wavelength of the radiation}$$
$$c = \text{Speed of light}(3.00\times 10^{8}\text{ms}^{-1})$$
$$\therefore \lambda \propto \frac{1}{E_\gamma}\tag{3}$$

### Energy in electron-volt (eV)
Photon energies are so small that the energy is better expressed in terms of the electron-volt.  

One electron-volt (eV) is the energy of an electron when accelerated through a potential difference of one volt.
$$1 \text{eV}=1.60\times 10^{-16}\text{J}\tag{4}$$

### Absorption Spectra

## 7.1.4 Radioactive Decay
An ***unstable*** nucleus can spontaneously and randomly emit $\alpha$-particles, $\beta$-particles and $\gamma$-particles.  
* Proton and nucleon number is ***conserved***
* Mass-energy is ***conserved*** while ***mass*** is **NOT** ***conserved***. 

### Decay
alpha( $\alpha$ )-decay:  
$$^{222} _{86}\text{Rn} \to ^{218} _{84}\text{Po} + ^{4} _{2}\text{He}$$
beta-minus( $\beta^{-}$ )-decay:  
$$^{1} _{0}n\to^{1} _{1}p+ ^{0} _{-1}e+^{0} _{0}\overline{\nu}$$
beta-plus( $\beta^{+}$ )-decay:  
$$^{1} _{1}p\to^{1} _{0}n+ ^{0} _{+1}e _{\text{p}}+^{0} _{0}\nu$$

$$^{238} _{92}\text{U}\to^{238} _{92}U+ ^{0} _{0}\gamma$$

|$\beta ^{+}$-particles|$\frac{1}{2000}u$|$+e$|$0.99c$|a few $mm$ of metal|medium|
|$\gamma$-particles|||speed of light|many $cm$ of lead|weak|

## 7.1.5 The Law of Radioactive Decay
The rate of decay is ***proportional*** to the number of nuclei that have ***not yet*** decayed
$$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} \propto N \space (A\propto N)\tag{5}$$  

$$A = \text{Activity (decay rate), the number of decays per unit time} $$  

$$\text{Unit: becquerel (Bq)}$$

### Half Life
The time taken for the number of nuclei or the activity decaying into its half of its initial value.  
$$N \to \frac{1}{2}\tag{6}N$$

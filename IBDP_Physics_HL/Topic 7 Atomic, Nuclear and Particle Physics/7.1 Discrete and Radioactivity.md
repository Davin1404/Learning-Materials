# 7.1 Discrete and Radioactivity
## Understanding 
* Discrete energy and discrete energy levels  
* Transitions between energy levels  
* Radioactive decay  
* Fundamental forces and their properties  
* Alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays   
* Half-life  
* Absorption characteristics of decay particles  
* Isotopes  
* Background radiation  

## Rutherfordâ€™s Gold Foil Experiment
### Observation
* Most of the alpha particles are undeflected.  

* Some deflected by small angles less than $90\degree$

* A small number of alpha particles rebounded by large angles more than $90\degree$.  

### Conclusion
* As most alpha particles passed through the gold foil atoms undeviated, Rutherford concluded that most of the atom was actually empty space.

* The deviation of some alpha particles from their original path were due to positive charges within the foil.

* A small number of alpha particles had rebounded because they collided with something much larger and heavier and which contains a concentrated region of positive charge.

### The Atom 
* **Atom**
  * ***Nucleus*** (radius: $10^{-15}m$)
    * Protons (named **nucleons**)
    * Neutrons (named **nucleons**)
  * Orbiting electron

### The Nuclides
$$^{\text{nucleon num}}_{\text{proton num}}\text{element symbol}$$
$$^{A}_{Z}X$$

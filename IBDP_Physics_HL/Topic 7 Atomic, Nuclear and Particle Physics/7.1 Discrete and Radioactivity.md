# 7.1 Discrete and Radioactivity
## Understanding 
* Discrete energy and discrete energy levels  
* Transitions between energy levels  
* Radioactive decay  
* Fundamental forces and their properties  
* Alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays   
* Half-life  
* Absorption characteristics of decay particles  
* Isotopes  
* Background radiation  

## Rutherfordâ€™s Gold Foil Experiment
### Observation
* Most of the alpha particles are undeflected.  

* Some deflected by small angles less than $90\degree$

* A small number of alpha particles rebounded by large angles more than $90\degree$.  

### Conclusion
* As most alpha particles passed through the gold foil atoms undeviated, Rutherford concluded that most of the atom was actually empty space.

* The deviation of some alpha particles from their original path were due to positive charges within the foil.

* A small number of alpha particles had rebounded because they collided with something much larger and heavier and which contains a concentrated region of positive charge.

### The Atom 
* **Atom**
  * ***Nucleus*** (radius: $10^{-15}m$)
    * Protons (named **nucleons**)
    * Neutrons (named **nucleons**)
  * Orbiting electron

### The Nuclides
$$^{\text{nucleon num}} _{\text{proton num}} \text{element symbol}$$  
$$^{A} _{Z}X$$

### Isotopes
Are *nuclei* of the same element with ***different*** numbers of neutrons but the ***same*** number of protons.  
* *Neon*: $^{20}_{10}\text{Ne}$ , $^{22}_{10}\text{Ne}$ , $^{22}_{10}\text{Ne}$
* *Hydrogen*: $^{1}_{1}\text{H}$ , $^{2}_{1}\text{H}$ , $^{3}_{1}\text{H}$

### Forces in the nucleus
[7.3.4 Exchange Particles](./7.3%20The%20Structure%20of%20Matter.md#734-exchange-particles)

* Electronstatic force / Coulomb force
* Strong nuclear force
* Weak nuclear force
* Gravitational force

## 7.1.2 Energy Level
It refers to the ***amount of energy*** an electron possesses of a ***given orbit***.  

Starting from ground state, the ***innermost*** orbit, the amount of energy ***increases*** as ***radius increases***.  

The loss of energy of the electron during a *transition* from a *higher* energy to a *lower* energy level leads to the ***emission*** of a ***single photon*** of light
$$E_2-E_1=hf$$
$$\therefore E_{\gamma} = hf$$
$$E_{\gamma} = \text{The energy carried by a photon}$$
$$h = \text{Plank constant}(6.63\times 10^{-34}\text{Js})$$
$$f = \text{Frequency of the radiation} $$

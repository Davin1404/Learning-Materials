# 7.3 The Structure of Matter
## 7.3.1 Elementary Particles 
### Hadron 

   1. Baryons $\to$ Three quarks
   2. Mesons $\to$ an quarks and an antiquarks  

### Quarks
   1. Beta decay in terms of quark model
   2. Baryon number
   3. Strangeness
      1. 不守恒 in weak interaction

### Leptons
3. Leptons
   1. six types

### Exchange Particles
1. Electromagnetic interaction
   1. Photon
2. Weak interaction
   1. $W+$, $W-$ and $Z^0$
3. Strong interaction 
   1. Gluons ($\text{g}$)
   2. Mesons ($\pi^+$,$\pi^-$,$\pi^0$)
4. Gravitational force
   1. Gravitation

## 7.3.2 Confinement
It is not possible to observe isolated quarks, they exist in groups within hadrons

## 7.3.3 The Higgs particle

temp：fuel enrichment means that the amount of uranium-235 present in the fuel is increased
this means that more U-235 available for fission
therefore the reaction can be sustained

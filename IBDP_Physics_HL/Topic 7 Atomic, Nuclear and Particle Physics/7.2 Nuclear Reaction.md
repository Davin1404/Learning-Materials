# 7.2 Nuclear Reaction
## 7.2.1 Mass Defect and Binding Energy
### Unified atomic mass unit(U)
$\frac{1}{12}$ of the rest mass of an unbound atom of ***carbon-12*** in its nuclear and electronic ground state, having a value of $1.661\times10^{-27}\text{kg}$  
$$u=1.661\times10^{-27}\text{kg}=931.5\text{ MeVc}^{-2}\tag{1}$$  

$$m_p = 1.007276 u$$  

$$m_n = 1.008665 u$$  

$$m_e = 0.000549 u$$  


### Binding energy
Energy required to ***separate*** *nucleans* into all of its constituent *nucleons* to infinity.   

* Proton & nentron has ⚠️ ***NO!*** ***NO!*** ***NO!*** ⚠️ binding energy because they are ***single nucleon***.  😡

### e.g. Binding energy of a deuteron
> 氘核（deuteron）是由一个质子（proton）和一个中子（neutron）组成的原子核
1. A free proton and a free neutron ***collide***.  

2. The proton and neutron ***combine*** to form a deuteron with the **binding energy being carried away by a *photon***.   

3. A ***photon*** of energy ***greater*** than the binding energy of the deuteron is **incident** on the deuteron.  

4. The proton and neutron ***separate*** with their total $E_{\text{kinetic}}$ ($Q_k$) ***being difference between the photon energy and the binding energy*** needed to separate the proton and neutron. 
$$Q_k=E_{\gamma}-E_{\text{binding}}$$ 

5. The free proton and neutron have a ***GREATER*** total rest mass than the deuteron, here comes to the ***mass defect of a nucleus***.  
$$m_p + m_n > m_{\text{deuteron}}$$

### The mass defect of a nucleus
The difference between the total mass of the **separate nucleons** and the **combined mass of the nucleus.**  

### Mass-energy relation:  

$$E=mc^2\tag{2}$$  

$$E=\text{Energy}(\text{MeV})$$  

$$m=\text{The equivalent mass}(\text{MeV c}^{-2})$$  

$$(u=1.661\times10^{-27}\text{kg}=931.5\text{ MeVc}^{-2})$$

$$c=3.00\times 10^8\text{ms}^{-1}$$

### Mass-energy equivalence
The energy equivalent of the mass defect of a nucleus.  

$$s$$  

$$\Delta m = \text{Mass defected}$$  

### Mass and energy units for nuclear changes (MeV)
[Energy in electron-volt (eV)](7.1%20Discrete%20and%20Radioactivity.md#energy-in-electron-volt-ev)

In the mass-energy relation $E=mc^2$, energy is measured in $\text{MeV}$.  
$$ \text{MeV}=\text{eV}\times 10^{6}\tag{4}$$

### Binding energy per nucleon (Stability of nuclei)
The ***total energy*** needed to ***completely*** separate ***all*** the ***nucleons*** in a ***nucleus*** divided by the number of nucleons in the nucleus.  

* The nuclear binding energy of ***large*** nuclei tends to be **LARGER** than that for ***smaller*** nuclei. This is because, with a greater number of nucleons, *there are more opportunities for the*  ***Strong Force*** *to act between nucleons.
* [e.g. Binding energy of a deuteron](#eg-binding-energy-of-a-deuteron)
$$m_1 + m_2 > m_3\tag{5}$$

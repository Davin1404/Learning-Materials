# 7.2 Nuclear Reaction
## 7.2.1 Mass Defect and Binding Energy
### Unified atomic mass unit(U)
$\frac{1}{12}$ of the rest mass of an unbound atom of ***carbon-12*** in its nuclear and electronic ground state, having a value of $1.661\times10^{-27}\text{kg}$  
$$u=1.661\times10^{-27}\text{kg}=931.5\text{ MeVc}^{-2}\tag{1}$$  

$$m_p = 1.007276 u$$
$$m_n = 1.008665 u$$
$$m_e = 0.000549 u$$

### Binding energy
Energy required to ***separate*** *nucleans* into all of its constituent *nucleons* to infinity.   

### e.g. Binding energy of a deuteron
> 氘核（deuteron）是由一个质子（proton）和一个中子（neutron）组成的原子核
1. A free proton and a free neutron ***collide***.  

2. The proton and neutron ***combine*** to form a deuteron with the **binding energy being carried away by a *photon***.   

3. A ***photon*** of energy ***greater*** than the binding energy of the deuteron is **incident** on the deuteron.  

4. The proton and neutron ***separate*** with their total $E_{\text{kinetic}}$ ($Q_k$) ***being difference between the photon energy and the binding energy*** needed to separate the proton and neutron. 
$$Q_k=E_{\gamma}-E_{\text{binding}}$$ 

5. The free proton and neutron have a ***GREATER*** total rest mass than the deuteron.  
$$m_p + m_n > m_{\text{deuteron}}$$

## 12.1.1 Energy and momentum of a photon 
## 12.1.2 Photoelectric effect  
[7.1.2 Energy Level](../Topic%207%20Atomic,%20Nuclear%20and%20Particle%20Physics/7.1%20Discrete%20and%20Radioactivity.md#7.1.2-energy-Level)  

Einstein explained the photoelectric effect in the following way:  
* Light can be considered to consist of photons.   

$$E=\hbar f\tag{1}$$  

* Each photon can only ***interact*** with a ***single*** electron.  
* ***Threshold frequency*** $f_0$
  * Below which no electron can be emitted.  
* ***Work function*** $\Phi$ 
  * Energy that is ***needed*** to do the work ***overcome*** the attractive forces that act on the electron within the metal.  
* Any further energy supplied **BY** a photon becomes the ***kinetic energy*** of the emitted electron (photoelectron).  
* Increasing the ***intensity*** of ***light*** simply ***increases*** the ***number*** of photons incident per second.   

### Einstein’s photoelectric equation

$$E_{\text{max}}=\hbar f - \Phi = qV_{\text{stop}} \tag{2}$$  

$$E_{\text{max}} = \text{The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron}$$  

$$\Phi = \text{Work function of the metal}$$  

$$q=\text{Charge }(1.60\times 10^{-19}\text{C})$$  

$$V_{\text{stop}}=\text{Stopping voltage}$$

* The stopping voltage $V_{\text{stop}}$ refers to the voltage difference required to ***stop electrons*** from moving between plates and ***creating a current*** in the photoelectric experiment.

## 12.1.6 Wave function and Schrödinger’s equation  

Schrödinger’s wave function $\Psi$ describes the ***quantum state*** of particles. His wave equation has many similarities to a classical wave equation but it is not a derived equation.  

$$E(\text{Unit:eV})=-\frac{13.6}{n^2}$$  

$P(r)$ is the probability of finding a particle in a distance $r$ from a chosen origin.  

$$P(r)=|\Psi|^2 \Delta V$$  

$$P=\text{The probability}$$  

$$r=\text{The distance from a chosen origin}$$  

$$\Psi = \text{The Schrödinger’s equation}$$  

$$\Delta V = \text{The volume being considered}$$

$$\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac{\hbar}{4\pi}$$  

$$\Delta E = \text{Uncertainty in energy}$$

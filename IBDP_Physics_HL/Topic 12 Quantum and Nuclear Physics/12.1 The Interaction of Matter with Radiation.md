## 12.1.6 Wave function and Schrödinger’s equation  

Schrödinger’s wave function $\Psi$ describes the ***quantum state*** of particles. His wave equation has many similarities to a classical wave equation but it is not a derived equation.  

$$E(\text{Unit:eV})=-\frac{13.6}{n^2}$$  

$P(r)$ is the probability of finding a particle in a distance $r$ from a chosen origin.  

$$P(r)=|\Psi|^2 \Delta V$$  

$$P=\text{The probability}$$  

$$r=\text{The distance from a chosen origin}$$  

$$\Psi = \text{The Schrödinger’s equation}$$  

$$\Delta V = \text{The volume being considered}$$

## 12.1.2 Photoelectric effect  
[7.1.2 Energy Level](../Topic%207%20Atomic,%20Nuclear%20and%20Particle%20Physics/7.1%20Discrete%20and%20Radioactivity.md#7.1.2-energy-Level)  

Einstein explained the photoelectric effect in the following way:  
* Light can be considered to consist of photons.   

$$E(J)=\hbar f\tag{1}$$  

* Each photon can only ***interact*** with a ***single*** electron.  
* ***Threshold frequency*** $f_0$
  * Below which no electron can be emitted.  
* ***Work function*** $\Phi$ 
  * Energy that is ***needed*** to do the work ***overcome*** the attractive forces that act on the electron within the metal.  
* Any further energy supplied **BY** a photon becomes the ***kinetic energy*** of the emitted electron (photoelectron).  
* Increasing the ***intensity*** of ***light*** simply ***increases*** the ***number*** of photons incident per second.   

### Einstein’s photoelectric equation

$$E_{\text{max}}=\hbar f - \Phi = eV_{\text{s}} \tag{2}$$  

$$E_{\text{max}} = \text{The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron}(J)$$  

$$\Phi = \text{Work function of the metal}$$  

$$e=\text{Elementary charge }(1.60\times 10^{-19}\text{C})$$  

$$V_{\text{s}}=\text{Stopping voltage}$$

* The stopping voltage $V_{\text{s}}$ refers to the voltage difference required to ***stop electrons*** from moving between plates and ***creating a current*** in the photoelectric experiment.  
* ⚠️Tips:  
  * since $V\propto\frac{1}{current}$,  when light of the same intensity but ***higher frequency*** is incident on the same metal surface, ⚠️***photoelectric current DECREASES***⚠️.  
  *  when light of the ***higher intensity*** but same frequency is incident on the same metal surface, ⚠️***photoelectric current INCREASES***⚠️.  



### Millikan's photoelectric experiment 

$$E_{\text{max}}=\hbar f - \Phi $$  

$$\therefore eV_{\text{stop}}=\hbar f-\hbar f_0$$  

$$\therefore eV_{s}=\frac{\hbar c}{\lambda} -\frac{\hbar c}{\lambda_{0}}$$  

$$\therefore V_s = \frac{\hbar c}{e}(\frac{1}{\lambda}-\frac{1}{\lambda_{0}})\tag{3}$$

## 12.1.3 De Broglie wavelength  
Matter could also have wave-like propertices, the wavelength $\lambda$ associated with a particle (all particle) is given by:  

$$\lambda = \frac{\hbar}{p}\tag{1}$$  

$$p=\text{The momentum of the particle }(p=mv)$$  

For photon:  

$$\lambda \propto \frac{1}{E_{\gamma}}\tag{2}$$  

$$E_{\gamma}=\text{Total of the rest energy and kinetic energy of photon}$$  

### Electron diffraction ⚠️this is for electron😡
When ***electrons*** are accelerated through a potential difference they gain ***kinetic energy***.  

$$eV=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$  

$$\because p=mv$$  

$$\therefore p=\sqrt{2meV}$$

$$\therefore \lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2meV}}\tag{3}$$  

$$\lambda \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{E_k}}\tag{4}$$  


## 12.1.4 Pair annihilation and pair production 
## 12.1.5 Quantisation of angular momentum 
### Rutherford atom model

An atom is mostly empty space, with electrons orbiting a fixed, positively charged nucleus in set, predictable paths.


### The Bohr model
* Electrons in an atom exist in stationary states.  
* Electrons may move from one stationary state to another by absorbing or emitting a quantum of electromagnetic radiation.  
  * The difference in energy between stationary states is given by:  
$$\Delta E = hf$$  

* The angular momentum of an electron in a stationary state is quantized in integral values of $\frac{\hbar}{2\pi}$.  

$$mvr=\frac{n\hbar}{2\pi}$$  

>the electrons accelerate and so radiate energy
>
> they would therefore spiral  into (盘旋进入) the nucleus/atoms would be unstable
>
>electrons have discrete/only certain energy levels
>
>the only orbits where electrons do not radiate are those that satisfy the Bohr condition

## 12.1.6 Wave function and Schrödinger’s equation  

Schrödinger’s wave function $\Psi$ describes the ***quantum state*** of particles. His wave equation has many similarities to a classical wave equation but it is not a derived equation.  

$$E(\text{Unit:eV})=-\frac{13.6}{n^2}\tag{1}$$  

$P(r)$ is the probability of finding a particle in a distance $r$ from a chosen origin.  

$$P(r)=|\Psi|^2 \Delta V\tag{2}$$  

$$P=\text{The probability}$$  

$$r=\text{The distance from a chosen origin}$$  

$$\Psi = \text{The Schrödinger’s equation}$$  

$$\Delta V = \text{The volume being considered}$$  

$$V \propto -\frac{1}{r}\tag{3}$$

## 12.1.7 The Heisenbarg uncertainty principle 

$$\Delta x \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{4\pi}$$  

$$\Delta x = \text{Uncertainty in position}$$  

$$\Delta p = \text{Uncertainty of momentum}$$

## 12.1.8 The uncertainty in energy and time 

$$\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac{\hbar}{4\pi}$$  

$$\Delta E = \text{Uncertainty in energy}$$  

$$\Delta t = \text{Uncertainty of time}$$

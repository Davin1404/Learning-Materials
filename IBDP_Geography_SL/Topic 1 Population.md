# Population abd Economic Development Patterns  

## Physical Factors Influencing Population  
### Climate  
* Temperature  
  * not in extreme cold and heat  
* Terrain
* Nutrient-rich soil  
* Rainfall  

### Freshwater
* Nutrient-rich sediments  
* Food, water and trade

### Close to Coasts  
* Moderate maritime climate
* Trading port
* Abundance of food  

## Human Factors Influencing Population  
### Agricultural Innovation  
* Green revolution  
  * Large-scale dams  
  * High-yield variety seeds  
  * Electrified irrigation systems  

### Industrialisation  
* Industrial Revolution  

### Urbanization  
* Industrialisation and economic development  
* Natural increase and larger family size  

## Population Density may fall  
* Education  
* Cultural shifts  
* Female emancipation  
* Family planning  
* Material and leisure wealth  

## Global Patterns of Economic Development  
* MEDC
* NICs
* LEDSs
* LDC
* CPEs (Centrally planned economies)

## Economic cores 
where industry, investment and wealth are greatest, create a mutiplier effect, which reinforces further investment in industry, further attracting people to the area for employment.  

## How to achieve demographic dividend
1. Decrease IMR, increase LE  
2. Natural increase, BR remain unchanged, IMR decreased  
3. Decrease FR/BR, bulge will graduate enter working stage  
4. $<15$, education opportunities for "bulge"  
5. $>15$, job opportunities (economic reform, planning, infrastructure construction, FDI)

## Benefits of demo. dividend
* Increased labor supply
* Increase in saving
* Healthier women (since less fertility rate) and fewer social and economic pressures at home  
* Allows parents to invest more resource per child, leading to better health and educational outcomes
* Increasing domestic demand
* Economic growth

## Population at risks of trafficking
#### Who are they?
* Women  
* Children  
* Poor  
* LGBTI  
* Disable (mental/physical)  

#### Why?  
* Physical vulnerable  
* Female as sex worker  
* Children are demanded highly: sex abuse  
* Low access to education: have low awareness  
* Marginalized in society (difficult to be paid attention, difficult to get assistance)

## Anti-trafficking
### Trafficking in Persons Report  
#### Three main components:
* Protection: increased efforst to protect froeign national victims as well as non-immigrants.  
* Prosecution: off traffickers related to forced labor and sexual exploitation.  
* Prevention: to assist other government to reduce trafficking: border control, residence registration.  

### Other attempts
* Increasing public awareness abbout the risks.  
* having up-to-date registration of births and migration into an area.  
* allowing trade unions, to protect worker's rights and to reduce trafficking.  

### Overall
* No single strategies, nor only single country can end human trafficking.  
* Muti-governmental appraoch with many response is needed.

# Topic 3 Global resource consumption and security

* Water
* Food
* Energy

***Extreme poverty***: people who are living on less than 1.9 dollars per day.  

***Middle class***: people who are living on at least 4 dolloars per day. 

Answer the following questions:
1) How can growing middle class affect on China’s food consumption? (Time scale)

2) how can the change of China’s food consumption may have effect on other resources such as water/energy? (interrelation with other resource)

3) how can the change of China’s food consumption affect other regions in the world? (Place scale)


4) How can the change of China’s food consumption affect different skate holders? Choose at least free in the video (different perspectives)

Global development processes have a major impact on resource consumption.  

## what are developent process?
* urbanization
* industralization
* agricultural revolution
* consumerism 

## Biocapacity
An ecosystem's capacity to produce resources that are used by people and to absorb waster materials produced by humans, assuming current technology and management systems.  

The earth's biocapacity per person is the basis of calculating the ecologicla footprint.  

## Ecological footprint
Is the hypothetical area of *land* required by a society, a group or an individual to fulfill all their ***resource*** needs and assimilate all their ***wastes***. It is **measured in global hectares (gha)**.

⚠️Both **biocapacity** and **Ecological Footprint** are expressed in a **common unit** called a ***global hectare*** (gha)⚠️

## Components of Ecological Footprint
The ecological footprint adds up all the ecological services people demand that compete for space.  

It includes the biologically productive area (or biocapacity) needed for 

* Crops
* Grazing land
* Built-up areas
* Fishing grounds
* Forest products
* The area of forest needed to absorb carbon dioxide emissions that cannot be absorbed by the ocean.  

## How to increase a country's ecological footprint:
* relying heavily on fossil fuels  
* increasing its use of technology and, therefore, energy (but technology can also reduce the footprint)  
* high levels of imported resources (which have high transport costs)  
* large per capita production of carbon waste (that is, high energy use, high fossil fuel use)  
* Large per capita consumptionn of food  
* having a meat-rich diet  

## How to reduce a country's ecological footprint:
* reducing the amounts of resources it uses  
* recycling resources  
* reusing resources  
* improving the efficiency of resource use  
* reducing the amount of pollution it produces  
* transporting waste to other countries to deal with  
* improving technology to increase carrying capacity  
* importing more resources from other countries  
* reducing its population to reduce resource use  
* using technology to increase carrying capacity (e.g. using GM crops to increase yield on the same amount of land)  
* using technology to intensify land use  

## Why does LICs tend to have smaller ecological footprints than HICs?
* in HICs, ***more disposable income***
  * high consumption and demand for energy resources 
* in HICs, resource use is often wasteful
  * more waste and pollution as by-products of production 
* in LICs, ***less*** to spend to consumption and ***informal economy*** in LICs is responsible for recycling many resources.  
* ⚠️However, as LICs develop, their ecological footprint size increases⚠️
* A ***meat-eating diet***
* ***Greenhouse gas emissions*** from agriculture

## Virtual (embedded) water
* The concept 
  * the way in which water is transferred from one country to another through its exports. These exports may be foods, flowers or manufactured goods.  
* For example
  * it allows countries with limited water resources to "outsource" their water from countries that have more water resources. 
  * Mexico imports maize, and thereby saves 12 billion cubic metres of water each year.

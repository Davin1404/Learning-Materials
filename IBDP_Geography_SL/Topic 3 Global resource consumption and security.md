# Topic 3 Global resource consumption and security

* Water
* Food
* Energy

***Extreme poverty***: people who are living on less than 1.9 dollars per day.  

***Middle class***: people who are living on at least 4 dolloars per day. 

Answer the following questions:
1) How can growing middle class affect on China’s food consumption? (Time scale)

2) how can the change of China’s food consumption may have effect on other resources such as water/energy? (interrelation with other resource)

3) how can the change of China’s food consumption affect other regions in the world? (Place scale)


4) How can the change of China’s food consumption affect different skate holders? Choose at least free in the video (different perspectives)

Global development processes have a major impact on resource consumption.  

## what are developent process?
* urbanization
* industralization
* agricultural revolution
* consumerism 

## Biocapacity
An ecosystem's capacity to produce resources that are used by people and to absorb waster materials produced by humans, assuming current technology and management systems.  

The earth's biocapacity per person is the basis of calculating the ecologicla footprint.  

## Ecological footprint
Is the hypothetical area of *land* required by a society, a group or an individual to fulfill all their ***resource*** needs and assimilate all their ***wastes***. It is **measured in global hectares (gha)**.

⚠️Both **biocapacity** and **Ecological Footprint** are expressed in a **common unit** called a ***global hectare*** (gha)⚠️

## Components of Ecological Footprint
The ecological footprint adds up all the ecological services people demand that compete for space.  

It includes the biologically productive area (or biocapacity) needed for 

* Crops
* Grazing land
* Built-up areas
* Fishing grounds
* Forest products
* The area of forest needed to absorb carbon dioxide emissions that cannot be absorbed by the ocean.  

## How to increase a country's ecological footprint:
* relying heavily on fossil fuels  
* increasing its use of technology and, therefore, energy (but technology can also reduce the footprint)  
* high levels of imported resources (which have high transport costs)  
* large per capita production of carbon waste (that is, high energy use, high fossil fuel use)  
* Large per capita consumptionn of food  
* having a meat-rich diet  

## How to reduce a country's ecological footprint:
* reducing the amounts of resources it uses  
* recycling resources  
* reusing resources  
* improving the efficiency of resource use  
* reducing the amount of pollution it produces  
* transporting waste to other countries to deal with  
* improving technology to increase carrying capacity  
* importing more resources from other countries  
* reducing its population to reduce resource use  
* using technology to increase carrying capacity (e.g. using GM crops to increase yield on the same amount of land)  
* using technology to intensify land use  

## Why does LICs tend to have smaller ecological footprints than HICs?
* in HICs, ***more disposable income***
  * high consumption and demand for energy resources 
* in HICs, resource use is often wasteful
  * more waste and pollution as by-products of production 
* in LICs, ***less*** to spend to consumption and ***informal economy*** in LICs is responsible for recycling many resources.  
* ⚠️However, as LICs develop, their ecological footprint size increases⚠️
* A ***meat-eating diet***
* ***Greenhouse gas emissions*** from agriculture

# Water
## Virtual (embedded) water
* The concept 
  * the way in which water is transferred from one country to another through its exports. These exports may be foods, flowers or manufactured goods.  
* For example
  * it allows countries with limited water resources to "outsource" their water from countries that have more water resources. 
  * Mexico imports maize, and thereby saves 12 billion cubic metres of water each year.  

# Food
## Trends 1: food intake increasing, diets changing
* Food intake (measured in calorie intake)
  * steadily increased on a global scale. While calorie intake has remained steady in sub-Saharan Africa, it has increased dramatically in East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.  
* A change in diet away from cereals towards a more varied diet including meat, vegetables and dairy products. This pattern is most clearly observed as LICs become MICs.  

### Reasons for consuming more meat
1. Declining meat price
   1. Food consumption is price-dependent
   2. However, demand is "inelastic", which means that a person's consumption of food will only increase up to a certain point, even if they have more money available to pay for it.  
2. Increasing urbanization
   1. Fast-food industry
   2. It has been estimated that the number of people that can be supported on 1 hectare varies
      1. 22 for potatoes
      2. 19 for rice
      3. 2 for lamb
      4. 1 for beef

## Trend 2: falling growth rate of food production and crop yield
### Reasons
Natural hazards (fires, floods, drought), global climiate change, and the use of land to produce biofuels.  

### How to increase crop production?
* Expanding the are farmed
* Multicropping, often using irrigation 
* Using high-yielding varieties or genetically modified organisms. 
* Reducing food losses
* Improving food storage

# Energy
### Hydrocarbon
Non-renewal energy: Gas, Coal, Oil, "firewood"(有争议)

### Tidal
Tidal energy is a form of hydropower that relies on the rising and falling of the sea levels and tidal energy devices convert the energy gained from the tides into electricity.

## Nuclear energy

## Why higher energy insecurity 
* Increased demand 
  * especially from newly industrializing countries (NICs)
* Decreased reserves as supplies are used up
* Geopolitical developments
  * countries with oli resources such as Russia have been able to "flex their economic muscles" in response to the decreasing resources in the Middle East and the North Sea
* Global warming and natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina (2005), which have increased awareness about the misuse of energy resources
* Terrorist activity 
  * such as in Syria
* The conflict 
  * such as Russia and Ukraine

## Changing global energy demand 
The major consumers of energy are the HICs.  

The world continues to use fossil fuels despite the growth in renewable energy sources. (recoverable resources, existing infrastructure, energy companies as important sources of revenus for governments, powerful lobbyists)

The geographical pattern of demand is projected to shift from the OECD region to NICs

### Nexus
A complicated series of connections between different things.

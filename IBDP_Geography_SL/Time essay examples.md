> "The impacts on migration and health are likely to be the more destabilising consequences of global climate change" Discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.  

There is great uncertainly concerning the future impacts of climate change but it is becoming clear that unless temperature rise can be limited to 2 Â°C, the impacts will be severe and unevenly distributed. Climate change threaten water and food insecurity as well the flooding of low-lying nations like Bangladesh. Many factors combined will destabilise such countries. Both health and migration have the potential to destabilise at a range of spatial scales. 

Climate change is likely to bring about enormous environmental change.  

Examples include estimated sea rise of between 60 and 80 cm by the end of the century. Increased drought in arid environments as well as the onset of heavier more unpreditable rainfall events andn flooding in tropical and temperate regions. Glacial retreat will lead to increased water insecurity and soil erosion partly due to poor land management will increase food insecurity; with yields falling in already food insecure regions with gains being made in some temperate regions.   

Individually each of these factors alone have the potential to destabilise nations.  

Competition for vital resources is likely to increase at a range of scales from the local to the global. The search for grasslands will lead nomadic farmers to take larger migratory routes with inevitable conflict with sedentary farmers. Competition for local water resources, falling groudwater and salt free soils will lead to increased water and land conflict. Such conflicts will be local and regional.   

With increased water stress and falling crop yields as well as the migration of disease vectors such as the mosquito, there is bound to be greater impact on health. Such health impacts will have grave consequences for economic stability, impacting productivity and growth.
